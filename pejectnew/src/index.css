/* index.css - Cleared default Vite styles */

/*
  It's generally recommended to keep this file minimal.
  Global resets and base typography/theme variables should ideally be in
  src/styles/reset.css, src/styles/radiance.css, and src/styles/global.css
  which are already being imported in main.tsx.
*/

/*
  If there are any absolute base styles required by the Vite/React setup itself
  (unlikely for modern versions beyond what html/body receive from reset),
  they could remain. For this project, aiming for Radiance styles,
  it's best to let radiance.css and global.css define the body and html base.
